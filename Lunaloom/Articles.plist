		<key>Intro</key>
		<string>Getting a good night’s sleep isn’t just about the number of hours you spend in bed—it’s also about when you sleep. Understanding your body’s natural rhythms can help you wake up refreshed and full of energy. In this article, we’ll explore the science behind sleep timing and how you can use it to your advantage.</string>

			<string>Your sleep is divided into cycles, each lasting about 90 minutes. These cycles are made up of different stages:

Light Sleep (Stages 1 &amp; 2): Your body starts to relax, and your brain begins to slow down.

Deep Sleep (Stage 3): This is the most restorative part of sleep, where your body repairs itself and strengthens your immune system.

REM Sleep (Stage 4): This stage is crucial for memory and creativity, as your brain becomes highly active and dreams occur.

Waking up in the middle of a sleep cycle can leave you feeling groggy, even if you’ve had enough hours of sleep. By waking up at the end of a cycle, you’re more likely to feel alert and ready for the day.</string>
			<string>To snooze smarter, plan your sleep so that you wake up at the end of a cycle. Here’s how:

Determine Your Wake-Up Time: Start with when you need to wake up and work backward.

Count Backward in 90-Minute Increments: Aim for 5 or 6 full sleep cycles (7.5 or 9 hours of sleep).
• Example: If you need to wake up at 7:00 AM, try to fall asleep around 9:30 PM or 11:00 PM.

Account for Falling Asleep: Most people take about 15 minutes to fall asleep, so include that buffer in your calculations.</string>
			<string>Stick to a Schedule: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends, to regulate your body’s internal clock.

Use Sleep Apps or Calculators: These tools can help you determine the best bedtime based on your wake-up time.

Avoid Sleep Disruptors: Limit caffeine, heavy meals, and screen time in the evening to help you fall asleep faster.

Wind Down Before Bed: Relaxing activities like reading, meditation, or gentle stretching can signal to your body that it’s time to sleep.</string>

			<string>Your body thrives on routine, and going to bed and waking up at the same time each day helps regulate your internal clock. Even on weekends, try to stick to your schedule to maintain a steady rhythm.

Quick Win: Pick a bedtime and wake-up time that you can maintain every day, even on weekends.</string>
			<string>Prepping your mind and body for sleep is essential. Engaging in relaxing activities before bed, like reading, meditating, or stretching, can signal your body that it’s time to rest.

Quick Win: Establish a 30-minute pre-bed ritual that includes calming activities like listening to soft music or dimming the lights.</string>
			<string>Your bedroom should be a sanctuary for rest. A dark, cool, and quiet room promotes better sleep quality.

Quick Win: Keep your bedroom between 60-67°F (15-19°C), use blackout curtains, and eliminate noise distractions with white noise or earplugs.
</string>
			<string>The blue light from screens can trick your brain into thinking it’s still daytime, making it harder to fall asleep.

Quick Win: Avoid screens for at least an hour before bed or use blue-light filters if you need to check your phone or laptop.</string>
			<string>Caffeine, alcohol, and heavy meals before bed can interfere with sleep. Opt for light, sleep-friendly snacks if you’re feeling hungry late at night.

Quick Win: Swap out late-night coffee for herbal tea and avoid eating large meals at least two hours before bedtime.</string>

		<string>Unplug to Recharge: How to Create a Tech-Free Sleep Zone</string>
		<key>Image</key>
		<string>sleep3</string>
		<key>Intro</key>
		<string>In today&apos;s digital world, screens are everywhere—from our phones and tablets to TVs and laptops. But all that screen time can take a toll on your sleep. The blue light emitted by devices interferes with your body&apos;s natural sleep cycle, making it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep. Creating a tech-free sleep zone can help you relax, unwind, and get the restful night’s sleep you deserve. Here’s how to do it!</string>
		<key>Headings</key>
		<array>
			<string>1. Set a Digital Curfew</string>
			<string>2. Remove Devices from the Bedroom</string>
			<string>3. Create a Relaxing Pre-Sleep Routine</string>
			<string>4. Adjust Your Bedroom Lighting</string>
			<string>5. Use Tech-Free Alternatives for Sleep Aids</string>

			<string>Blue light from screens suppresses melatonin, the hormone that helps you sleep. Reducing screen time before bed allows your body to naturally prepare for sleep.

Quick Tip: Set a “no screens” rule at least 30-60 minutes before bedtime to help your body wind down.</string>
			<string>Keeping screens out of the bedroom removes the temptation to scroll late at night. It also eliminates sleep disruptions from notifications and bright screens.

Quick Tip: Charge your phone outside the bedroom or use an old-fashioned alarm clock instead of your phone’s alarm.</string>
			<string>Instead of screen time, replace your evening routine with calming, screen-free activities.

Ideas: Read a book, practice deep breathing, journal, or do some gentle stretching before bed.</string>
			<string>Bright, artificial light at night can keep you alert when you should be winding down.

Quick Tip: Use warm, dim lighting in the evening, such as bedside lamps, salt lamps, or candles, to create a cozy atmosphere.</string>
			<string>Many people rely on their phones for white noise, guided meditation, or sleep tracking, but these can keep you tethered to screens.

Quick Tip: Try using a physical white noise machine, offline meditation recordings, or a simple journal to track your sleep habits instead.</string>
